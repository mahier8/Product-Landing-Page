# Product Landing Page
This project displays a product landing page for a typical online furniture store. 
***
### Why the project is useful
Using different elements, such as a navbar with an icon and links, an input field for the users email, an iframe for a video and a footer at the bottom of the page, the project shows a few of many possibilities a landing page may have.

### How you can get started with the project
freeCodeCamp offers great resources which helped me get started, and the product landing page is one of the neccessary projects to complete in the Responsive Web Design module.
